                                            This question, of course, depends on how much time you have to dedicate to
                                            calligraphy. It
                                            only
                                            takes a day to get the
                                            mechanics of it down (thus the popularity of single day calligraphy
                                            workshops)! But
                                            proficiency, of
                                            course, takes
                                            practice. For most people with a fairly busy schedule, it will take two
                                            months until you’re
                                            making

                                            Sure! I’ll use myself as an example. I’ve got an entire blog post that
                                            explains how I learned calligraphy (read it
                                            here). Here’s the gist of it: With the help of the internet, I started
                                            teaching myself calligraphy in 2012. Knowledge
                                            came to me in little scraps: everything I saw helped me to learn, albeit in
                                            a roundabout sort of way, so it took me
                                            about a year to feel comfortable with my skill level. You’ve got an
                                            advantage over me because the TPK website exists,
                                            and with it, you’ve got comprehensive online courses and tons of helpful
                                            articles.

                                            Ink bleed is one of the most common beginner issues, and it almost always
                                            has to do with your materials. Paper is
                                            everything, and you can learn about the optimal papers to use in this
                                            article! My favorite practice paper is 32#
                                            laserjet because it’s wonderful for the dip pen and so economical. If you
                                            have to write on paper that’s not conducive to
                                            calligraphy, you can try thickening up your ink with gum arabic to
                                            discourage the ink from quickly soaking into the
                                            paper.

                                            It’s difficult to put all lefties into one general group. Lefties who don’t
                                            have a problem keeping their hand under what
                                            they’re writing (in everyday life) generally experience a smoother
                                            transition into calligraphy. Lefties who write with a
                                            hook might have a little bit more trouble figuring out the optimal hand
                                            position. Whether you’re right- or left-handed,
                                            calligraphy success is all in finding the grip that works for you. Your grip
                                            should facilitate comfort and give you the
                                            power to exert balanced pressure on both the left and right tines of the
                                            nib. Here are two helpful articles for lefties

                                            My best advice for flourishing is to make a pencil draft first! Sometimes, a
                                            certain flourish will seem like a good idea
                                            until you try it out. It’s better to learn that a flourish doesn’t work in
                                            pencil rather than in ink. As you make
                                            flourishes, try to think in ovals rather than circles. Flourishes that look
                                            more like a circle often have a less
                                            professional look. Finally, take it slow! Think of each stroke juncture as
                                            an opportunity to take a tiny break and
                                            gather up the confidence to make another lovely, confident stroke. For more

                                            Problem areas vary for each calligraphy learner, but in general, I notice
                                            that pressure exertion gives beginners
                                            trouble! As you’re writing, it’s important to exert balanced pressure on
                                            both tines of the nib. Otherwise, your nib will
                                            catch on paper, you’ll have issues with ink flow, and it will be difficult
                                            to control the thickness of your strokes. To
